My first dive into Node JS.

Here Ill be posting code for various things involvinf Node JS or just Javascript in general. I am planning on learning as much Node JS and Javascript over Winter Break 2013. My ultimate goal is to be able to use Node JS to connect a database with a REST api that can be accessed by various third party applications.
